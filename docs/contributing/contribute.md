# Contributing to OpenBullet

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the OpenBullet project! This page and its children describe the ways you can contribute, as well as some of our policies. This should help guide you through your first Issue or PR.

Even if you cannot contribute code, you can still help OpenBullet! The two main things you can help with are testing and creating issues. Contributing to code, documentation, and other non-code components are all outlined in the sections below.

## Reporting Issues

We use GitHub extensively to track open issues, new enhancements or features, and other aspects of development.

Please see the [documentation on issues](/docs/general/contributing/issues) for more information on how to submit good issues.

## Developing Code

The entire project consists of a .NET core solution (written in C#) for the web client's API, the native Windows WPF client, and the underlying libraries. In addition, for the web client, the frontend is written in TypeScript using Angular. If you have experience with these languages, we're always grateful for any contributions you might want to make!

For general guidelines on how the project works, including how to set up your development copy, make changes, and guidelines on Pull Requests (PRs), please see the [documentation on contributing code](/docs/general/contributing/development). OpenBullet follows a "fork and PR" methodology; if you're not familiar with this, please see the [relevant section](/docs/general/contributing/development#set-up-your-copy-of-the-repo).

## Adding To Documentation

Documentation is incredibly helpful! All these docs are written using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features). You can find the raw markdown in the [documentation repository](https://github.com/openbullet/openbullet2-docs). Pull requests are welcome!

## Testing

Testing is the easiest way to contribute. Simply use OpenBullet, and if you run into problems, [let us know](https://discourse.openbullet.dev/). This is the most common way we uncover bugs, through a user doing something we hadn't thought about. If the issue does end up being related to the code, a [bug issue](/docs/general/contributing/issues#reporting-bugs) can then be opened.
