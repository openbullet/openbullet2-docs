# Building OpenBullet 2 from source

## Why build from source
If you don't trust the official release builds hosted on GitHub, or if you want to make some modifications to the [source code](https://github.com/openbullet/OpenBullet2/) of OpenBullet 2, you might want to compile your own build instead of using a premade one.

## Prerequisites
Install the following
- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)
- [Node.js 20](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (for the web client only)

:::info Info
Make sure to install the .NET 8 SDK and not the Runtime.
:::

## Building the Web Client from its source code
Open your favourite terminal (or git bash) and run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openbullet/OpenBullet2/
```

now cd into the folder where `OpenBullet2.Web.csproj` resides

```bash
cd OpenBullet2/OpenBullet2.Web
```

and compile OB2 using

```bash
dotnet publish --configuration Release
```

Navigate to the `openbullet2-web-client` folder

```bash
cd ../openbullet2-web-client
```

Then install the required npm packages using

```bash
npm install
```

and finally build the web client using

```bash
npm run build
```

Copy the contents of the `dist` folder to the `OpenBullet2/OpenBullet2.Web/bin/Release/net8.0/publish/wwwroot` folder

```bash
cp -r dist/* ../OpenBullet2.Web/bin/Release/net8.0/publish/wwwroot
```

you can then navigate to the publish folder and start OB2 with the usual command

```bash
cd ../OpenBullet2.Web/bin/Release/net8.0/publish
dotnet ./OpenBullet2.Web.dll
```

You should see some text like in the screenshot below

## Building the Native Client from its source code (Windows only)
Open your favourite terminal (or git bash) and run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openbullet/OpenBullet2/
```

now cd into the folder where `OpenBullet2.Native.csproj` resides

```bash
cd OpenBullet2/OpenBullet2.Native
```

and compile OB2 Native using

```bash
dotnet publish --configuration Release
```

you can then navigate to the publish folder (`bin/Release/net8.0/publish`) and double-click on `OpenBullet2.Native.exe` to run it.

You should now be able to see the application's homepage
